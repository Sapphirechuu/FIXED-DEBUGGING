# Debugging Practice, Zerglings vs. Marines
## Rules:
- Each Zergling and Marine will attack once per turn. Each Zergling will attack the first living Marine, and each Marine will attack the first living Zergling.
- Once either team is out of living members, they have lost.
- This is an automated simulation. You cannot change the outcome unless you specifically change values in the code.
